<h2> About the Subject: </h2>
<p>Anthropology, “the science of humanity,” which studies human beings in aspects ranging from the biology and evolutionary history of Homo sapiens to the features of society and culture that decisively distinguish humans from other animal species. Because of the diverse subject matter it encompasses, anthropology has become, especially since the middle of the 20th century, a collection of more specialized fields. Physical anthropology is the branch that concentrates on the biology and evolution of humanity. It is discussed in greater detail in the article human evolution. The branches that study the social and cultural constructions of human groups are variously recognized as belonging to cultural anthropology (or ethnology), social anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and psychological anthropology (see below). Archaeology (see below), as the method of investigation of prehistoric cultures, has been an integral part of anthropology since it became a self-conscious discipline in the latter half of the 19th century.</p>




<h3> Anthropology as a distinct discipline came into existence in 19th century and was differentiated into following fields : </h3>

<li>  Physical anthropology, emphasizing the biological process and endowment that distinguishes Homo sapiens from other species.</li>
<li>Archaeology, based on the physical remnants of past cultures and former conditions of contemporary cultures, usually found buried in the earth. </li>
<li> Linguistic anthropology, emphasizing the unique human capacity to communicate through articulate speech and the diverse languages of humankind.</li>
<li>Social and/or cultural anthropology, emphasizing the cultural systems that distinguish human societies from one another and the patterns of social organization associated with these systems. </li>
<li> Psychological anthropology, emphasizing the relationships among culture, social structure, and the human being as a person. </li>


<h3> Below are some of the questions which anthropologists study:</h3>
<li>How did humans evolve? </li>
<li> How do different cultures adapt to their environment?</li>
<li> How do languages develop and change? </li>
<li> How do social groups form and function?</li>
<li> How do people create and maintain meaning in their lives?</li>
<li> What are the causes and consequences of conflict and violence?</li>
<li> How can we create a more just and equitable world?</li>


<p> Anthropology in itself is a broad subject which meticulously studies various vital subfields in order to understand the mankind/humans much better. Anthropology is one of the most fascinating subjects under Humanities. Learning about the Humans, how the customs and cultures emerged, and became what they are in present is truly highly rewarding and interesting. </p> </div>
